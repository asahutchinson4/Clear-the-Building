PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS

# Group-Project
An FPS made in UE4 with blueprints

# Overview of Project
A group project that turned into a solo project. In my advanced game development course we all had been individually working on a game and then about two-thirds through the semester our professor put us all in groups of three to combine our projects together. The two I got paired with were working in Unity and wanted to switch over to Unreal with me. With Covid, source control issues and problems with their computers not being able to handle Unreal, this project ending up being a solo gig for me. After the course was finished, I trashed the little work my groupmates completed because their work was so half-ass. Therefore, everything you see in my game was done by me.
