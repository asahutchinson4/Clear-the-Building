# Group-Project
An FPS zombie game made in UE4 using blueprints

# Preface
A group project that turned into a solo project. In my advanced game development course we all had been individually working on a game and then about two-thirds through the semester our professor put us all in groups of three to combine our projects together. The two I got paired with were working in Unity and wanted to switch over to Unreal with me. With Covid, source control issues and problems with their computers not being able to handle Unreal, this project ending up being a solo gig for me. After the course was finished, I wanted to continue on with the project throughout winter break but didn't want their work to be apart of it so I trashed the little work my groupmates completed. Therefore, everything you see in my game was done by me.

# Overview of Project
I started this project for my advanced game development course. Our goal was to expand our knowledge in game development by trying something new and to take what we had learned from the prerequisite course, foundations of game development. I chose to use UE4 because I had became very familiar with Unity and wanted to push myself. My goal was not to make a complete game but to make an almost playable game with many features. I added features such as a dynamic main menu with key bindings, a physics system, a halo inspired health system, and an unique level environment.

# Backstory/Story
You play as Nikolai Egorov (“Nico”), a former Russian spec ops member. He was one of the deadliest and most skilled militants before he decided to come to America for a better life. The Russian government was so impressed with Nico’s talents that they attempted to capture him in order to make clones. This forced Nico into hiding from the Russian government and he decided to move to New York, in search of the American dream but what he found instead was quite the opposite. Nico landed a job as a swat team member in Brooklyn. A few months later a worldwide pandemic was discovered but it was too late. This pandemic infected the whole planet, but its only symptom reveals itself after death. Once you die, you turn into a flesh-eating monster. Zombies have overrun Brooklyn and Nico’s team has been tasked with clearing each building in their assigned perimeter. Play as Nico and clear the building you’ve been tasked with.

# What I Learned
I mostly learned about UE4, blueprints and the differences between 3D and 2D game development. This was a big change for me and I had a lot of fun. 

# Contributors
None. I used the internet for tutorials and lots of free assets.

# Build
This is not a full game nor is it meant to be built. I have only worked within the editor.
